# Hodge/Podge

## Convert Java 1.8+ time and date classes to and from legacy time and date classes

This project attempts to provide a comprehensive set of example conversion
methods to translate between any combination of legacy API dates and
times and new API dates and times -- with unit tests.

Perhaps you've got a Calendar and you need a ZonedDateTime. Maybe you're
doing your calculations using Instant objects, but one legacy API still
needs a java.util.Date. This code will hopefully show you how to handle
that correctly.  Conversions are performed as directly as possible. None
of these conversions are particularly complicated, but I found half a
dozen bugs while adding the unit tests, so I think it's worthwhile using
reference code rather than writing your own every time.

That said, this code comes with no warranty express or implied, as per
the license. Please perform your own tests before using it for anything
important.

## Domino and XPages conversions

For those who use IBM Domino and Java, the XHodgePodge class implements
conversion between Domino DateTime objects and Java date and time classes.

Because there's no easy way to get good time zone information out of
DateTime objects, conversion to Calendar and ZonedDateTime types happens
by parsing the text output of DateTime.getZoneTime(). The parsing is
performed by assembling a Java 8 DateTimeFormatter based on the Domino
i18n settings obtained from the International class.
